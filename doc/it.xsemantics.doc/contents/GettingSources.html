<h1>Getting Sources</h1>
<p>
If you want to get the sources of Xsemantics,
for instance, to contribute new features and patches, you can get them
via Git.  However, we strongly reccomend to
use the automatic procedure detailed below.
</p>
<p>
We use <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer">Oomph</a> for provisioning
a full Eclipse IDE and workspace setup for Xsemantics.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Download and start Oomph: <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer">https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		On the initial page, click on the Switch to advanced mode button in the top right
	</li>
	<li>
		On the Product page, select "Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers" (you can also select another product if you want,
		but we prefer to start with this minimal product and the Oomph setup will install all the needed plug-ins).
	</li>
	<li>
		On the Projects page, expand the node "Github Projects".
	</li>
	<li>
		Double-click on "Xsemantics", and choose the Stream (usually you choose "master", which is the default).
	</li>
	<li>
		Choose your preferred installation settings on the Variables page:
		in particular for "Xsemantics Github repository", choose read or read/write.
	</li>
	<li>
		Then specify your Github user ID and password (these are used for Mylyn issues).
		Note that the "Authenticate..." button is currently not working
		(<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=479309">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=479309</a>).
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Press next and finish.
This will first create an Eclipse installation with all the needed plug-ins
and then it will start the new installed Eclipse (press Finish to close the first installation dialog).
The new installed Eclipse will automatically setup the workspace and you will have to wait for this procedure
to end (you can click on the animated arrow icon on the status bar to show the progress).
During this procedure you may be asked for additional passwords (especially if you use the Eclipse
feature for storing passwords in a keyring).
